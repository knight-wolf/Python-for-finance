We've made changes to the prediction function. Please [read the new documentation](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2#prediction-function)

## Trading Problem Overview ##
This problem requires a mix of statistics and data analysis skills to create a predictive model using financial data. We will provide you with a toolbox and historical data to develop and test your strategy for the competition.

1. [Getting Started](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2#quick-startup-guide)
2. [How does the toolbox work?](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2#how-does-the-toolbox-work)
3. [Available Feature Guide](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2#available-feature-guide)

## Quick Startup Guide ##
### Install Python and dependent packages ### 
You need Python 2.7 (Python 3 will be supported later) to run this toolbox. For an easy installation process, we recommend Anaconda since it will reliably install all the necessary dependencies. Download [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions on the [installation page](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).   Once you have Python, you can then install the toolbox.

### Get the Quant Quest Toolbox ###
There are multiple ways to install the toolbox for the competition.

The easiest way and the most recommended way is via pip. Just run the following command:
`pip install -U auquan_toolbox`
If we publish any updates to the toolbox, the same command `pip install -U auquan_toolbox` will also automatically get the new version of the toolbox. 

**Note**: Mac users, if you face any issues with installation, try using 'pip install --user auquan_toolbox' 

### Download [Problem1.py](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2/blob/master/problem1.py) 
Run the following command to make sure everything is setup properly

        python problem1.py

### Make your changes
Use *problem1.py* as a template which contains skeleton functions (with explanation) that need to be filled in to create your own trading strategy. You need to fill in the `getFairValue()` function for problem 1. 
For problem 2, fill in the `getClassifierProbability()` function for problem 2.

## How does the toolbox work? ##

### Getting Data ###
The data for the competition is provided [here](https://github.com/Auquan/auquan-historical-data/tree/master/qq2Data). The toolbox auto-downloads and loads the data for you. You can specify the training dataset you want to load in `getTrainingDataSet()` function.
```python
def getTrainingDataSet(self):
        return "sampleData"
        # Set this to trainingData1 or trainingData2 or trainingData3
```

You can specify the instruments to load in function `getSymbolsToTrade()`. If you return an empty array, it downloads all the stocks.
```python
    def getSymbolsToTrade(self):
        return []
 ```
 You then need to create features and combine them in the prediction function to generate your predictions. 

Features and predictions are explained below. The toolbox also provides extensive functionality and customization. While not required for the competition,you can read more about the toolbox [here](https://bitbucket.org/auquan/auquantoolbox/wiki/Home)

### Creating Features ##
Fill in the features you want to use in *`getFeatureConfigDicts()`* function. Features are called by specifying config dictionaries. Create one dictionary per feature and return them in a dictionary.

**Feature config Dictionary has the following keys:**
  > *featureId:* a string representing the type of feature you want to use  
  > *featureKey:* {optional} a string representing the key you will use to access the value of this feature  
  >            If not present, will just use featureId  
  > *params:* {optional} A dictionary with which contains other optional params if needed by the feature  
  
  **Example**: If you only want to use the moving_sum feature, your *`getFeatureConfigDicts()`* function should be:
  ```python
  def getFeatureConfigDicts(self):
        msDict = {'featureKey': 'ms_5',
                'featureId': 'moving_sum',
                'params': {'period': 5,
                'featureName': 'basis'}}
        return [msDict]
```
You can now use this feature by calling it's featureKey, 'ms_5'        
Full list of features with featureId and params is available [here](https://github.com/Auquan/quant-quest-2/blob/master/README.md#available-feature-guide).

***Custom Features***
To use your own custom features, follow the example of class `MyCustomFeature()` in problem1.py. Specifically, you'll have to:
1. create a new class for the feature and implement your logic in the function `computeForInstrument()` - you can copy the class from `MyCustomFeature()`
Example:
```python
class MyCustomFeatureClassName(Feature):
    @classmethod
    def computeForInstrument(cls, featureParams, featureKey, currentFeatures, instrument, instrumentManager):
        return 5
```        
2. modify function `getCustomFeatures()` to return a dictionary with Id for this class (follow formats like `{'my_custom_feature_identifier': MyCustomFeatureClassName}`. Make sure 'my_custom_feature_identifier' doesnt conflict with any of the pre defined feature Ids
```python
def getCustomFeatures(self):
        return {'my_custom_feature_identifier': MyCustomFeatureClassName}
```
        
3. create a dict for this feature in `getFeatureConfigDicts()`. Dict format is:
```python
  customFeatureDict = {'featureKey': 'my_custom_feature_key',
                         'featureId': 'my_custom_feature_identifier',
                          'params': {'param1': 'value1'}}
```
You can now use this feature by calling it's featureKey, 'my_custom_feature_key'

Instrument features are calculated per instrument (for example position, fees, moving average of instrument price). The toolbox auto-loops through all intruments to calculate features for you.

## IMPORTANT: We've made changes to this function, please make sure to change your file accordingly ##
### Prediction Function ###

Combine all the features to create the desired prediction function. For problem 1, fill the funtion `getFairValue()` to return the predicted FairValue(expected average of future values). 
Here you can call your previously created features by referencing their featureId. For example, I can call my moving sum and custom feature as:
```python
    def getFairValue(self, updateNum, time, instrumentManager):
        # holder for all the instrument features
        lookbackInstrumentFeatures = instrumentManager.getLookbackInstrumentFeatures()

        # dataframe for a historical instrument feature (ms_5 in this case). The index is the timestamps
        # atmost upto lookback data points. The columns of this dataframe are the stock symbols/instrumentIds.
        ms5Data = lookbackInstrumentFeatures.getFeatureDf('ms_5')
        
        

        # Returns a series with index as all the instrumentIds. This returns the value of the feature at the last
        # time update.
        ms5 = ms5Data.iloc[-1]

        return ms5
 ```
 
 **Important:** Previously, we were calling `lookbackInstrumentFeatures = instrument.getDataDf()`, which returned the holder for all instrument feature and then ` lookbackInstrumentFeatures['ms_5']` which returns a dataFrame for that feature for one stock. **Now we first call the holder for all the instrument features** as `lookbackInstrumentFeatures = instrumentManager.getLookbackInstrumentFeatures()` and then dataframe for the feature as  `lookbackInstrumentFeatures.getFeatureDf('ms_5')` which returns a dataFrame for that feature for **ALL stocks** at the same time. Rest of the code is same.**


Output of the prediction function is used by the toolbox to make further trading decisions and evaluate your score.
